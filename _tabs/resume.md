# EDUCATION

## PhD in Mechanical and Process Engineering
**2023 - Present**

*ETH Zürich - Inspire AG* (Zurich, Switzerland)

My thesis aims to apply learning based methods to optimize the control of Wire EDM and Die-Sinking EDM machines. The focus is on improving efficiency, speed, and accuracy over traditional methods like PIDs.

## MSc in Physics
**2018 -- 2020** 

*ETH Zürich* (Zurich, Switzerland)  
Focused on:
- Quantum information: theory and implementations
- Machine Learning
- Quantum Field Theory and Gravitation

**Master Thesis**: Extracting physical parameters from an environment using AI-agents  

- *Abstract:* Development of a new architecture combining different reinforcement learning agents together with deep learning techniques to create agents capable of designing experiments to gain physical insight.  
- *Supervisors:* Raban Iten, Renato Renner  

## BSc in Physics
**2014 -- 2018**  
*Universidad Autónoma de Madrid* (Madrid, Spain)  

**Theoretical BSc Thesis**: Quantum violation of Leggett-Garg inequalities in condensed matter systems  

**Experimental BSc Thesis**: Entropy waves in super-ﬂuid helium-IV
