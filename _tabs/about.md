## What is this?

This is my personal website. The main purpose of this website is to have a place
where I can share my thoughts and projects with others. I want it
to be a place to share my learnings. It's a space designed for
exchanging knowledge amd conversations with others who share similar
interests. Feel free to explore and reach out if you're curious about a
collaboration or just want to chat.

## Why not to use a social network or GitHub?

I have a [GitHub](github.com/geduardo) account, and I use it to share my code
and projects. In fact, this website is hosted on GitHub Pages. However, a web
page offers more flexibility (e.g. I can use LaTeX to write my posts) and
customizability than a GitHub repository. I don't want to be tied to a
social network (e.g. Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.). I want to have full control over
the content, distribution, and presentation of what I share. Also, this makes my
content publicly indexed by search engines and available for everyone,
even if they don't have an account on a social network.

## Who am I?

Some info about me:
- My name is Eduardo González Sánchez. I was born in Madrid in 1996.
- I'm a physicist (or at least, I have a BSc and MSc in Physics). My focus
during my studies was mainly theoretical physics, but I'm slowly moving towards
applied physics and engineering. 
- I'm currently doing a PhD at ETH Zurich, mainly doing research on how to
  control [Electrical Discharge
  Machining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_discharge_machining)
  machines with learning-based methods.
- I speak Spanish, English, and I'm currently (but slowly) learning German.
- I currently live in Zurich, but I also spend some time in Madrid.
- I like to explore the Swiss Alps with my mountain bike.¨
